Hence we learn to program and tell computers to do what we are very slow at - computation. If I ask you to calculate 5+6, you will immediately say 11. How about 23453453 X 56456?

Programming is a way for us to tell computers what to do. The computer is a very dumb machine and it only does what we tell it to do. Hence we learn to program and tell computers to do what we are very slow at - computation. If I ask you to calculate 5+6, you will immediately say 11. How about 23453453 X 56456? ? Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. ? Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.",

I was not so good with it but I used to write code for a singaporean client and actually make good money without having to actually master Python.

Two of them were highlighted, the first one being Component level styling, and the second one was global styling. Despite how great these technologies are, you'll always miss the simplicity of our good old HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. But Next JS lets you enjoy that convenience here as well. You can program your stylesheets targeting your classes just like you did in normal CSS even in Next Js with much more functionalities using a special syntax named style JSX. Using this makes it possible to write CSS specific to a particular component. That even makes it easier to add, change, and delete styles without worrying about how they will affect other components. You can even declare it globally following different methods. Let's just begin with style JSX without further ado.",

In order to avoid that complexity, we will store different blog posts in different JSON files. A better and more optimised solution using databases like MongoDB or SQL will follow later on, but for now let's learn how blog posts’ content stored in JSON files could be read and displayed on Hunting Coder through the NextJs file-system. Run your development server. Data must be stored somewhere for it to be fetched. Currently if you open your blog page and click on the title of the first blog, it navigates to a blog page and there is some content present. That content has been hard coded into the application. And hard coding is something developers shouldn’t do for a scaled project. So, we will create a folder named blogdata in the Hunting Coder directory. This folder will store all JSON files which are to be rendered on the website. For the sake of demonstration, I'll create a few examples. "  ,

Today, we’ll see how we can use these endpoints in our frontend and establish a connection between the frontend and the backend. We’ll strategize the calling of these API routes and much more. So, let’s just get started. Start by launching the development server. As of right now, you'll see a list of three blogs that are hard-coded into the program when you navigate to the blog page.
